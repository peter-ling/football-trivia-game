# football-trivia-game
A game in c++ where a user is given hints to guess a particular NFL football player. 

The FootballTrivia.cpp file serves as more of a header file where the main.cpp file can recieve information from, such as the player struct and the information about each player. 

This game is run in the command line and can be done so by running the main.cpp file. A demo video of the program running is also included in this repository.
